Persist Skin in Cookie
======================

This is a MediaWiki extension that persists the value of the "useskin" GET 
or POST parameter in a cookie. All subsequent requests will use that skin. 
This allows users to change the skin without having to register or log in.

Installation
------------

To insert a "skin switcher" in your template, put a link somewhere that has the 
"useskin=yor_skin_name" parameter for the current page. 

To use the default skin again, put a link in your template that has the parameter 
"usedefaultskin=1".

WARNING: The extension will only work if the file cache is off or 
$wgShowIPinHeader = true;

Interaction with settings of registered users
---------------------------------------------

If a users is logged and and chooses a different skin in the preferences, this
skin will always have precedence over the skin stored in the cookie.
Only when the user chooses the default skin the cookie-based skin switch will work again.
